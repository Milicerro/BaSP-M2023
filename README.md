# Become a Software Professional 2023

##### This project is based on the idea of creating a website for a gym. This website has several profiles with their respective functions. It is a working progress that week by week I am editing and uploading the changes. That means a new language will be added to the code every week, until the initial web page is rebuilt.

## This project is for:

## Week 01
In the first week we aimed to make a screenflow with different interactions, which we had to achieve using the Figma app.
The screenflow was based on a gym website.
To achieve this, we worked in subgroups of 2/3 people. Although, always communicating and coordinating with the whole team.

## Week 02
In the second week, we had to do the HTML code of the landing page, wich is the main of all.
To achieve this, we had to only use HTML, this is basic structure and the basic tags.

## Week 03
In the third week, we take the html code and add styles with css, always trying to achieve the landing page of the app.
This project was individual, but I still received help from my teammates.

## This is the Landing page;

## Week 04
In the fourth week, we had to make the landing page responsive. To make that, we had to use the FlexBox CSS to achieve it.
Also, in that week, we included the mobile and the tablet design. That was for the responsive part came. We had to start editing the initial HTML code of the Week-02 with the CSS code of the Week-03, to made the mobile first design, then, of that design we had to adap for tablet and desktop.

## Week 05
In the fifth week, we had to work with JavaScript. During the week, we develop exercises using this programming language.
Just to comment, this particular week is just for practicing and getting to know the language.

## Week 06
In the sixth week, we had to use the languages learned in the last weeks, to make the corresponding design for the login and sign-up page. We used HTML for the structure, CSS for the style and Js for the logic.

For these pages we had to validate the fields, make changes to the DOM with ECMAScript 5. For that we use events like blur, focus, among others.

The languages we used this week: ECMAScript5, html and css

## Week 07
In this seventh week, we must continue with what was developed in the previous week. Now, we need to extend the week 06 forms so that when the confirmation buttons are clicked, the data loaded into them is sent to a web server via an HTTP request from JavaScript and is also saved to local storage.

The validations must be shown with alerts, although if we got there well over time, we could do them with modals (which is what I did), modifying the HTML, CSS and Js logic.
