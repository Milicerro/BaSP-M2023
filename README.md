# Become a Software Professional 2023

##### This project is based on the idea of creating a website for a gym. This website has several profiles with their respective functions. It is a working progress that week by week I am editing and uploading the changes. That means a new language will be added to the code every week, until the initial web page is rebuilt.

## Week 01
In the first week we aimed to make a screenflow with different interactions, which we had to achieve using the Figma app.
The screenflow was based on a gym website.
To achieve this, we worked in subgroups of 2/3 people. Although, always communicating and coordinating with the whole team.

## Week 02
In this second week, we have to do the HTML code of the landing page, wich is the main of all.
To achieve this, we have to only use HTML, this is basic structure and the basic tags.
